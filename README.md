# 🌟 From Constellations to Calendars: Star Naming Trends
## 🏆 Achievements
- 🥇 **1st Place Winner** at Galactic Heist Competetion
- This project was developed as part of **“The Galactic Heist”**, a 15-hour exploratory data analysis (EDA) hackathon inspired by *Money Heist*. Participants were challenged to act like data detectives, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing complex datasets to crack the system and emerge victorious.

Just like the Professor and his crew, we strategized our data plan, extracted hidden insights, and delivered our findings through a compelling dashboard. The hackathon focused on:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Visualization using Power BI
- Storytelling with insights
 

A collaborative project exploring how stars have been named throughout history — from ancient constellations to modern calendars.
